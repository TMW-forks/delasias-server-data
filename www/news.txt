##3 Tinkering
##3 2010-01-11

##0 We start 2010 with some tinkering.
##0 And WOW have we been tinkering with a lot of 
##0 stuff. Check around Hurnscald for some
##0 new quests! Look for Da Boss, and for Bella they
##0 both have some things to do, some interesting 
##0 rewards.

##0 Also get some Druids advise for life from
##0 the Oracle. His wisdom is uncanny. He likes
##0 quiet outside places.

##0 All of these things are products of teamwork 
##0 with the players and developers. Enjoy !!
